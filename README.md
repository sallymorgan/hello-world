# hello-world
It's my very first repository. I'm so fricking proud of myself.
So, I teach 8th grade American History and a Computer Science Elective at Yale Junior High School. It is my 12th or 13th year of teaching, all in the same disrict.
I'm trying to learn how to use github so if i have questions about coding my students are doing, I can perhaps post those questions or code here, and get help from those more experienced than myself.
